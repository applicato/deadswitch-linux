# Dead Switch
## A Dead Man Switch for Linux



A dead man switch (DMS) is a mechanism (digital or physical) that triggers when the user fails to perform an action.

Dead Switch is a security application designed protect your data in case you are threatened by violence from people, organizations, government agencies. or you just want to have a secure way to send data in case something unexpected happens to you. It is a safeguard for your data, that if such a scenario were to occur, an email will be sent with your data to a specified person/s for safekeeping. 

Dead Switch will check-in at a specified interval chosen by you, whether you still have access to the machine. If you fail to check-in with the correct password, the email will be sent.

## Features

- user friendly terminal setup
- written in Bash and Python
- attach a file to your email
- location agnostic; all files contained in one folder
- simple to use

## Installation

Deadmanswitch requires [Python](https://www.python.org/) v3.8+ to run which should come pre-installed on the latest version of Debian based distros such as Ubuntu. The app uses BASH, but I think it would work with other shells like ZSH. 

There are no other known dependencies for this program. 

Unpack the files into any folder. Give all the files Read, Write, Execute permissions and run ./start.sh to start the setup.
